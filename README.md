This project serves as an example of a Rock Paper Scissors game that I am currently working on creating through The Odin Project Source material. This game aims to allow the player to compete against a computer in a best of three series of the classic, RPS. The computer will be using some of the material that I have learned so far in JavaScript. This includes using functions, defining variables, conditional statements, and logic based problems.
